        <h2>Work</h2>
        <p>
          I lead UX design and frontend development at Microsoft. I wear both designer's and engineer's (and
          increasingly PM's) hat from day one of each project. My unique trans-discplinary process finds the Goldilocks
          zone in product development where the needs and constraints from business, users, and technology are in
          perfect balance.

              My work inspires the sharing and reuse of. As a designer, the project honed my skills on creating and then
              maintaining a design system that balances internal and external consistencies. It also challenges me
              design incentive mechanisms for the long-term benefit of the users and the sustainability of the entire
              ecosystem.

              functionalities that involved swaping ASP.NET + Knockout.js with React, GraphQL and JAMStack.

            I've worked on the design system for the entire platform, and on applications built on top of the platform:
            a human capital management solution and an ecommerce solution.

            <p>
              As a designer, Dynamics 365 introduced me to system thinking. The platform is a multi-sided value network
              that involves the platform team, internal solution teams, partner solution teams, business organization,
              and business' customers. I learned valueable lessons in balancing the interests from all of the
              stakeholders above and designing mechanism that outlasts the change of people and processes.

          <p>
            Business intelligence app at enterprise scale. I worked at the intersection between backend and frontend.

            <p>
              I had never received design traning until this project. I was luck enough to be taken under the wings of a
              few talents designers. Through them, I discovered the great work from Edward Tufte and started reading
              volume after volume on typography, color theory, information architecture, and interaction design. I
              pushed the adoption of design system before it was popularized by Brad Frost. This period of learning
              paved the foundation for my later work as a designer.

              As a engineer, the project taught me my first lessons in building MV* applications. Many great developers
              selflessly coached me on design patterns, unit testing, asynchronous programming, and the cryptic art of
              debug CSS when IE support was a must. I also picked by D3.js as my go-to tool for data-driven
              visiualization.

        I'm a Human-Computer Interaction nerd. I go to great lengths to create systems, tools, and experiences that are
        functional and visual delights for individuals. These are the side projects I worked on all night without

            <p>
              The project aims to have zero dependency. Thanks to this constraint, I learned how to write a text editor,
              how to build a template engine, and how to handle DOM diffing for state-based rendering. I built a testing
              framework from scratch. And built a custom XML parser for handling RSS feed.

              As a designer, I started experimenting with various design languages, from console-inspired base64 theming
              system to modern minimalist material design. In the short term, the toolbox focuses on secondary tasks:
              reading articles, bookmarking websites, and taking notes.<br />
              In the long term, the toolbox creates a personalized learning environment for discovering new knowledge
              and synthesizing new insights.

              The tool went throught several iterations to fine-tuning the sensitivity and activation threshold. It also

              Performance is key in drivers. The project uses web animation API to reduce trashing and hand coded the
              entire UI and data process logic to reduce memory and CPU load. The logic is inspired by the "update loop"
              model in video games and real time systems.

              To align with the project's goal and account for the frequent rotation of volunteer developers, I
              emphasized on the learning curve and accessibility of the tech stack itself. By using plain CSS, instead
              of CSS-in-JS and semantic HTML, instead of off the shelf UI toolkits, the project allows for easy
              onboarding and cross-contribution between designers who can code.

              Dynamics 365 is a B2B platform that creates apps on-demand for each business. This made it difficult for
              the designers to access the environment. The tool provides a one-click solution to allow instant access to
              demo environments. The project itself also embodies the progression of HCI paradigms. V1 was CLI that
              converses with the user. V2 was a desktop app that user to install and interact with. V3 is currently a
              cloud service that provides what user needs just in time.

              The app repurposed browser automation testing tool to become a co-pilot of human users, allowing instant
