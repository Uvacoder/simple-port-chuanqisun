          where the needs and constraints from business, users, and technology are in perfect balance. Currently, I lead

          <h3>Education</h3>
          <p>
            I'm forever grateful for my liberal arts education at Dartmouth College. In addition to all the courses you
            would expect a C.S. major to have taken, I have also received introductory-level and yet rigorous training
            in drawing, photography, film studies, audio-visual programming, and 3D animation. The most unforgettable
            lecture? Having Alison Ouellette-Kirby and Noah Kirby teach us melting and pouring 2,220 °F liquid iron into
            our hand-prepared clay molds! I graduated in 2015 with highest honors.
