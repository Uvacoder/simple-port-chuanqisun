        <h2>Work</h2>
        <p>
          I lead UX design and frontend development at Microsoft. I wear both designer's and engineer's (and
          increasingly PM's) hat from day one of each project. My unique trans-discplinary process finds the Goldilocks
          zone in product development where the needs and constraints from business, users, and technology are perfectly
          balanced.

              My work inspires the sharing and reuse of. As a designer, the project honed my skills on creating and then
              maintaining a design system that balances internal and external consistencies. It also challenges me
              design incentive mechanisms for the long-term benefit of the users and the sustainability of the entire
              ecosystem.

              As an engineer, the project has taught me invalueable lessions in working with legacy systems. I
              successfully architected the migration of a full stack application without interrupting existing
              functionalities that involved swaping ASP.NET + Knockout.js with React, GraphQL and JAMStack.

          <h3>Dynamics 365</h3>
          <p>
            I've worked on the design system for the entire platform, and on applications built on top of the platform:
            a human capital management solution and an ecommerce solution.

            <p>
              As a designer, Dynamics 365 introduced me to system thinking. The platform is a multi-sided value network
              that involves the platform team, internal solution teams, partner solution teams, business organization,
              and business' customers. I learned valueable lessons in balancing the interests from all of the
              stakeholders above and designing mechanism that outlasts the change of people and processes.

            <p>
              I had never received design traning until this project. I was luck enough to be taken under the wings of a
              few talents designers. Through them, I discovered the great work from Edward Tufte and started reading
              volume after volume on typography, color theory, information architecture, and interaction design. I
              pushed the adoption of design system before it was popularized by Brad Frost. This period of learning
              paved the foundation for my later work as a designer.

              As a engineer, the project taught me my first lessons in building MV* applications. Many great developers
              selflessly coached me on design patterns, unit testing, asynchronous programming, and the cryptic art of
              debug CSS when IE support was a must.

        I'm a Human-Computer Interaction nerd. I go to great lengths to create systems, tools, and experiences that are
        functional and visual delights for individuals. These are the side projects I worked on all night without
        looking at my watch.

          <h3>osmoscraft</h3>
          <p>
            osmoscraft is a growing knowledge toolbox that pushes you to discover, ingest, organize, connect, generate,
            and share knowledge.

            <summary>Engineering</summary>
            <p>
              The project aims to have zero dependency. Thanks to this constraint, I learned how to write a text editor,
              how to build a template engine, and how to handle DOM diffing for state-based rendering. I built a testing
              framework from scratch. And built a custom XML parser for handling RSS feed.

            <summary>Design</summary>
            <p>
              As a designer, I started experimenting with various design languages, from console-inspired base64 theming
              system to modern minimalist material design. In the short term, the toolbox focuses on secondary tasks:
              reading articles, bookmarking websites, and taking notes.<br />
              In the long term, the toolbox creates a personalized learning environment for discovering new knowledge
              and synthesizing new insights.
