        <h2>Work</h2>
        <p>
          I am currently work at Microsoft to lead UX design and frontend development. For the past 7 years, I've
          purposefully chosen work that would give me experience in both engineering and design. I believe my
          interdiscplinary approach has allowed me to design experiences that are feasible and implement features that
          are delightful to use.

          <h3>HITS</h3>
          <p>
            HITS is Microsoft's internal knowledge base for product designers and researchers. My work inspires the
            sharing and reuse of knowledge among the users.

            As an engineer, the project has taught me invalueable lessions in working with legacy systems. I
            successfully architected the migration of a full stack application without interrupting existing
            functionalities that involved swaping ASP.NET + Knockout.js with React, GraphQL and JAMStack.
            <br />
            As a designer, the project honed my skills on creating and then maintaining a design system that balances
            internal and external consistencies. It also challenges me design incentive mechanisms for the long-term
            benefit of the users and the sustainability of the entire ecosystem.

          <h3>Dynamics 365</h3>
          <p>
            I've worked on the design system for the entire platform, and on applications built on top of the platform:
            a human capital management solution and an ecommerce solution.

            <p>
              As a designer, Dynamics 365 introduced me to system thinking. The platform is a multi-sided value network
              that involves the platform team, internal solution teams, partner solution teams, business organization,
              and business' customers. I learned valueable lessons in balancing the interests from all of the
              stakeholders above and designing mechanism that outlasts the change of people and processes.
            </p>
            <p>
              As an engineer, I honed my rapid prototying skills, from highly specific interactions to horizontal user
              flows. I also co-authored the design system that an whole of frontend engineers depend on.

          <h3>Power BI</h3>
          <p>
            Business intelligence app at enterprise scale. I worked at the intersection between backend and frontend.
            Building services that transfer data between on-premises servers and cloud hosted servers.

            <p>
              As a engineer, the project taught me my first lessons in building MV* applications. Many great developers
              selflessly coached me on design patterns, unit testing, asynchronous programming, and the cryptic art of
              debug CSS when IE support was a must.
            </p>
            <p>
              I had never received design traning until this project. I was luck enough to be taken under the wings of a
              few talents designers. Through them, I discovered the great work from Edward Tufte and started reading
              volume after volume on typography, color theory, information architecture, and interaction design. I
              pushed the adoption of design system before it was popularized by Brad Frost. This period of learning
              paved the foundation for my later work as a designer.

          <h3>osmoscraft</h3>
          <p>
            osmoscraft is a growing knowledge toolbox that pushes you to discover, ingest, organize, connect, generate,
            and share knowledge. <br />In the short term, the toolbox focuses on secondary tasks: reading articles,
            bookmarking websites, and taking notes.<br />
            In the long term, the toolbox creates a personalized learning environment for discovering new knowledge and
            synthesizing new insights.

            <p>
              The project aims to have zero dependency. Thanks to this constraint, I learned how to write a text editor,
              how to build a template engine, and how to handle DOM diffing for state-based rendering. I built a testing
              framework from scratch. And built a custom XML parser for handling RSS feed.
            </p>
            <p>
              As a designer, I started experimenting with various design languages, from console-inspired base64 theming
              system to modern minimalist material design.
